Compiling
=========

Compilation of the python module can be enabled by adding the flag '-python' to
the Boolector configure script call.

./configure -python

Note that all SAT solvers linked against Boolector must be compiled as shared
library, which can achieved as follows:

* Lingeling configure script:
  ./configure -fPIC

* PicoSAT configure script:
  ./configure -shared

* MiniSAT already provides a shared library

Using the module
================

Ensure that the module can be found by the python interpreter, i.e., set path
with PYTHONPATH="path/to/module". For examples on how to use the module see
api/python/api_usage_examples.py.

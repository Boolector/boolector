# Boolector installation steps on Windows

### Important preamble

These steps document what is necessary to build a 64-bit version of `pyboolector.pyd` on 64-bit Windows. They also do not guarantee the correctness of other parts of Boolector (e.g., the main `boolector.exe`).

To ensure the portability of `pyboolector.pyd`, every effort is made in this guide to avoid building Boolector with Cygwin (e.g., we wish to avoid a dependency on `cygwin1.dll`, which could affect the portability of `pyboolector.pyd`). Given this, the guide is written to use the MinGW-W64 "cross-compiler".

These notes are purposefully very detailed to allow for someone to go from a completely fresh Windows 10 installation to a working version of Boolector.

Finally, some of Boolector's dependencies have been _heavily_ modified to allow them to build on Windows. This means that functionality such as timeouts might be completely inoperable on Windows.


## Dependencies

### MinGW

Install MinGW-W64 from here:

* <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/mingw-w64/mingw-w64-release/>

You should select the "MinGW-W64 Online Installer" (`MinGW-W64-install.exe`).

The following options are recommended and have been tested when writing this guide:

* Version: 8.1.0
* Architecture: x86_64
* Threads: win32
* Exception: seh (default)
* Build revision: 0 (default)

When selecting the threading model, only the Win32 model has been validated -- the POSIX model has not been tested at all. On Windows, Boolector's make system has been modified to statically link, expecting the Win32 model.


### MSYS

Install MSYS from here:

* <https://www.msys2.org>

It is important to select the 64-bit installation option (`msys2-x86_64-<DATE>.exe`). There are no further choices to be made when installing MSYS.

Once MSYS is installed, start an MSYS shell, and run `pacman -Syuu`. Once this is complete, it will ask you to close the shell. Close MSYS, re-open it and re-run `pacman -Syuu` again. Once it is complete the second time, close and re-open MSYS. This process needs to be performed twice to allow for MSYS to first update itself, and then update its packages.

Now install the following:

* `pacman -S --needed make git vim wget patch tar`


### Python 3.8

Install the most recent 32-bit Python 3.8 from here:

* <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>

You should download the _x86-64Â MSI_. No specific choices need to be made when installing Python.

Update your `%PATH%` variable to include both the path to `python.exe ` and to the `Scripts` sub-directory of the Python installation. These paths will look something like:

* `C:\Python38`
* `C:\Python38\Scripts`

Or if installed for the current user only, something like:

* `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38`
* `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\scripts`

Once your `%PATH%` is set correctly, start `cmd` and run the following:

* `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
* `python -m pip install --upgrade cython`

### CMake

The version of CMake that comes with MSYS does not correctly support MSYS Makefiles (strangely). You should download the most recent version of CMake from here:

* <https://cmake.org/download/>

Downloading "Windows win64-x64 ZIP" (`cmake-<VERSION>-win64-x64.zip`) is sufficient. You do not need the installer.

When this is downloaded, extract the zip, but _remember the path you extracted it to_! You will need it later to the set the variable `CMAKE_DIR`.


## Building Boolector

### Configuring Boolector's build environment

Now that you have installed all of the necessary dependencies for Boolector, we need to configure our build environment. Start an MSYS shell, enter the directory you wish to build Boolector in, and create a file called `vars.sh`. The file should have the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

export PYTHON_DIR=$(cygpath -u "C:\Python38")
export CMAKE_DIR=$(cygpath -u "C:\cmake-3.17.0-win64-x64")
export MINGW_DIR=$(cygpath -u "C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-win32-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64")

export PATH=${PYTHON_DIR}:${PATH}
export PATH=${PYTHON_DIR}/Scripts:${PATH}
export PATH=${CMAKE_DIR}/bin:${PATH}
export PATH=${MINGW_DIR}/bin:${PATH}

# export DEBUG_FLAG="-g"
export DEBUG_FLAG=""
export COMPARCH=64   # for a 64-bit build!

export EXTRA_FLAGS="-static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc"

# -DMS_WIN64 is required so the Python headers properly detect a 64-bit build
export COMPFLAGS="${EXTRA_FLAGS} -I${PYTHON_DIR}/include -m${COMPARCH} -DMS_WIN64"

if [ -z "$DEBUG_FLAG" ]; then
    COMPFLAGS="-O3 -DNDEBUG ${COMPFLAGS}"
fi

export CFLAGS="${COMPFLAGS} -std=gnu11"
export CXXFLAGS="${COMPFLAGS} -std=gnu++11"
export PYTHON_INCLUDE="${COMPFLAGS}"
export LDFLAGS="${EXTRA_FLAGS} -L${PYTHON_DIR}/lib"

export CC="gcc"
export CXX="g++"

# EOF
```

Once you have created this file, you should run `source vars.sh`. You should now check the following:

* `which gcc`
* `which python`
* `which cmake`
* `which cython`

If any of these do not appear to look right, or return incorrect values, you need to check your contents of `vars.sh` -- pay special attention to `CMAKE_DIR` and `MINGW_DIR`!


### Obtaining Boolector

Now that you have configured your environment, you should obtain a copy of Boolector:

* `git clone https://github.com/Boolector/boolector`


### Building Boolector

The following steps will allow you to build Boolector from the above clone:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cd boolector

#
# Download, patch and build Boolector's dependencies
#

./contrib/setup-picosat.sh
./contrib/setup-lingeling.sh
./contrib/setup-cadical.sh
./contrib/setup-btor2tools.sh

#
# Modify pyboolector.pyx to be "more Windows compatible"
#
./contrib/fix_cython_windows.sh

#
# Build Boolector
#
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DPYTHON=ON -DIS_WINDOWS_BUILD=1 -G "MSYS Makefiles"
make -j12
cd ..

# EOF
```

_Notes:_

* On Windows, the above `setup` scripts automatically patch the version of Boolector's dependencies to enable them to compile with Windows -- as per the start of this guide, these changes may dramatically change Boolector's behaviour.
* The use of `-G "MSYS Makefiles"` is _highly_ essential to allow you to build Boolector on Windows.


### Testing Boolector

Now that you have built `pyboolector.pyd`, you can test it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# this script presumes it is run from the root of the Boolector clone

export PYTHONPATH=$(cygpath -d $(readlink -f build/lib))
python examples/api/python/api_usage_examples.py

# EOF
```

If you get uncaught exceptions on on `splice`, then you probably did not run `./contrib/fix_cython_windows.sh` before building.

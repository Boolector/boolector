Boolector @VERSION@ 

@DATE@

Source code release of Boolector. 

Boolector is an efficient SMT solver for the quantifier-free theory of
bit-vectors in combination with the quantifier-free extensional theory of
arrays.

For compilation please obtain the latest source code of Lingeling from
  
  http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling

Then extract from the archive the Lingeling sources in the same directory
in which you extracted the Boolector sources.  Rename or link the
Lingeling source directory to 'lingeling'.  Then compile Lingeling.

  For the current version of Lingeling this works as follows
  (replace <current> in the following by the actual version):

  cd <directory-where-you-extracted-boolector-sources>
  wget http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/lingeling-<current>.tar.gz
  tar xf lingeling-<current>.tar.gz
  ln -s  lingeling-<current> lingeling
  cd lingeling
  ./configure
  make

In the same way you can optionally include the current PicoSAT:

  cd <directory-where-you-extracted-boolector-sources>
  wget http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/picosat-<current>.tar.gz
  tar xf picosat-<current>.tar.gz
  ln -s picosat-<current> picosat
  cd picosat
  ./configure -O           # this will improve performance
  make

For additionally using MiniSAT as back-end do the following:

  cd <directory-where-you-extracted-boolector-sources>
  git clone https://github.com/niklasso/minisat.git
  cd minisat
  make

You need Lingeling, while PicoSAT and MiniSAT are optional.

Then issue

  ./configure
  make

Using MiniSAT will force 'libboolector.a' to depend not only on
'libz.so' but also on 'libstdc++.so'.  Thus if you want to link
'libboolector.a' with MiniSAT backend against your own programs,
then you need to use '-lz -lstdc++' as linking options.

This will produce the library 'libboolector.a' with its API
'boolector.h', the stand-alone SMT solver 'boolector', a
simple delta debugger 'deltabtor', and a small tool 'synthebtor',
which can be used to synthesize AIGs in Aiger format from BV.

In the 'examples' sub-directory you find two examples for using
the API, which are also described in the API documentation.  You 
can generate the documentation on the API with 'doxygen'.  Run

  doxygen

in the top level source directory.  Then point your browser at

  doc/html/index.html
